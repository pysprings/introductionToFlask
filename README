# firstapp - a simple example application, written in Flask
################################################################################

This is meant to be used as a tutorial and is purposely simple and somewhat
incomplete.

If you end up using this template for a more complicated application, it is
suggested that you modify the directory structure to allow for this
   firstapp/
   firstapp/templates/*
   firstapp/static/*
   firstapp/firstapp.py
   testing/
   testing/test_firstapp.py
   pytest.ini
   LICENSE
   README

Note that if you do modify the directory structure as mentioned above, the
imports in test_firstapp will need to be modified and __init__.py files
will need to be added to the firstapp/ and testing/ directories (even if they
are empty)
